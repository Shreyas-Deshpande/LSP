lseek system call

lseek() repositions the file offset of the open file description
       associated with the file descriptor fd to the argument offset
       according to the directive whence as follows:

       SEEK_SET
              The file offset is set to offset bytes.

       SEEK_CUR
              The file offset is set to its current location plus offset
              bytes.

       SEEK_END
              The file offset is set to the size of the file plus offset
              bytes.

       lseek() allows the file offset to be set beyond the end of the
       file (but this does not change the size of the file).  If data is
       later written at this point, subsequent reads of the data in the
       gap (a "hole") return null bytes ('\0') until data is actually
       written into the gap.
