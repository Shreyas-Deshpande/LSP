The MC34063A Series is a monolithic control circuit containing the
primary functions required for DC−to−DC converters. These devices
consist of an internal temperature compensated reference, comparator,
controlled duty cycle oscillator with an active current limit circuit,
driver and high current output switch. This series was specifically
designed to be incorporated in Step−Down and Step−Up and
Voltage−Inverting applications with a minimum number of external
components. Refer to Application Notes AN920A/D and AN954/D
for additional design information.
The input source type selection (SEL) pin is used to
select the input power source for the input current limit
control feature. With the SEL input high, the
MCP73871 device is capable of providing 1.65 (typical)
total amperes to be shared by the system load and Li-
Ion battery charging. The MCP73871 device limits the
input current up to 1.8A. When SEL active-low, the
input source is designed to provide system power and
Li-Ion battery charging from a U
