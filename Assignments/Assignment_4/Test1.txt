following few lines explains the return value of memcmp fucntion

 The memcmp() function returns an integer less than, equal to, or
greater than zero if the first n bytes of s1 is found,
respectively, to be less than, to match, or be greater than the
first n bytes of s2.

For a nonzero return value, the sign is determined by the sign of
the difference between the first pair of bytes (interpreted as
unsigned char) that differ in s1 and s2.

If n is zero, the return value is zero.
